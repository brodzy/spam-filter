# Spam Filter Via Naïve Bayes
Implemented a probabilistic classifier, Naïve Bayes, to create an email spam filter with a train test split of 80/20. A simple presence of some words in emails is predictive of spam (or ham) status. Words of dataset were cleaned and analyzed to be used as the training set and conditional probability distributions for a subset of words were calculated. The classifier was then evaluated to see how accurate the spam filter executed.
