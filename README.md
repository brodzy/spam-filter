# Spam Filter Via Naïve Bayes
Implemented a probabilistic classifier, Naïve Bayes, to create an email spam filter. The key idea behind this project is that the simple presence of some words
in emails is predictive of spam (or ham) status. This learning is done during the first phase, I analyzed the words of a dataset, called the training set, and learn conditional probability distributions for a subset of words. In the second phase, I evaluated the classifier classifieer on a separate dataset, called the test set.
